# ITDS - Introduction to Data Science 2122

## Welcome to the ITDS2122 Practicals Repository.

The main content of the repository is going to be notebook files `.ipynb`. In order to get updated every time there is an upload of a lesson or additional material create a [GitHub](https://github.com/join) account and **star** and **watch** the repository using the appropriate buttons (you can also follow me if you're interested to check my future repositories e.g.: coding challenges mainly in python).

_**IMPORTANT NOTE: This repository is going to contain both lessons files bult also extended versions for further study and it is going to be the sole material for the labs.**_

### Materials Download
 To download and use the material interactively you have at least two options (i do suggest the first one):

#### First Method \[suggested\]:
1. Install Git (Code Version Control Tool):
    - [Installation Guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
    - [What is a version control system?!?!?!](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control`)


2. Navigate to your favourite folder and perform the following command:

    - `git clone https://github.com/andreagalloni92/itds2122pr.git`


3. Every time there is an update after a lesson just go to the folder and  perform:
    - `git pull` 

*It is important for you to familiarize with git because it's something usefull and wide spread as a tool around the IT community.*

#### Second Method \[not suggested\]:
1. Click on the <span style="color:green;">Code button in green</span> (top-right)
2. Click on Download Zip
4. Unzip and enjoy!
3. Every time there is an update you will need to download everything from scratch.

### How do I run the examples interactively?
You have two options:
1. Install Jupyter notebook locally:
    - [Installation Guide](https://jupyter.org/install.html)
    - launch and navigate over the appropriate folder
    - open the appropriate `L*.ipynb` file
    - edit, run, comment and enjoy the learning journey!

2. Use [Google Research Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/):
    - Create a [Google account](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?hl=en&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp) if you don't have one yet
    - Upload the specific notebook and the related files if needed.
    - edit, run, comment and enjoy the learning journey!
